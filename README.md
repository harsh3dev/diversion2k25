AptoChain is an **Aptos- powered freelancing marketplace** that ensures propoer transparency on behalf of the freelenacers as well the clients by ensuring
- **Financial Security**:-  Utilizes a **Move Smart Contract** to divide tasks into milestones. Upon completing a milestone and receiving client approval, the corresponding payment is securely transferred.
- **Strict Accountability**:- In the event of a dispute between a client and a freelancer, either party can **initiate a dispute**. The issue is then resolved through a ***voting consensus by blockchain network members**, ensuring fairness and decentralization.
- **Fair representation**:-  Most freelancing platforms favor experienced freelancers, making it challenging for **newcomers to secure gigs**. However, in AptoChain, new members who participate in **voting consensus** during dispute resolution earn **trust tokens**. As these tokens accumulate, the freelancerâ€™s **credibility increases, enhancing their chances of being selected** for projects.
